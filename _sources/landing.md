# Quantum Computing Applications in Nuclear Physics

This book of background, tutorials, and applications of aspects of quantum computing was born out of the [2022 FRIB quantum computing summer school](https://github.com/NuclearPhysicsWorkshops/FRIB-TASummerSchoolQuantumComputing) and attempts to explore tools and techniques of interest to nuclear physicists.
