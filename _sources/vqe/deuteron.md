# Quantum Computing the Deuteron

TODO: Discuss 2018 paper [Cloud Quantum Computing of an Atomic Nucleus](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.210501), discuss the deuteron and the model maybe? It should be somewhere, maybe here instead of the notebook. Just need a light introduction before the real work.
